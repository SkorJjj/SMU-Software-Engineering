# Big Questions - Wealth and Poverty 
## Week 1
### Epictetus (1925) - The disclosures book [ To those who fear want ]


> Does a good man fear that food will fail him? It does not fail the blind, it does not fail the lame; will it fail a good man? A good soldier does not lack someone to give him pay, or a workman, or a cobbler; and shall a good man?[5] Does God so neglect His own creatures, His servants, His witnesses, whom alone He uses as examples to the uninstructed, to prove that He both is, and governs the universe well, and does not neglect the affairs of men, and that no evil befalls a good man either in life or in death?[6]—Yes, but what if He does not provide food?—Why, what else but that as a good general He has sounded the recall? I obey, I follow, lauding my commander, and singing hymns of praise about His deeds. 30For I came into the world when it so pleased Him, and I leave it again at His pleasure, and while I live this was my function—to sing hymns of praise unto God, to myself and to others, be it to one or to many. God does not give me much, no abundance. He does not want me to live luxuriously; He did not give much to Heracles, either, though he was His own son, but someone else was king over Argos and Mycenae, while he was subject, and suffered labours and discipline. And Eurystheus, such as he was, was not king over either Argos or Mycenae, for he was not king even over himself; but Heracles was ruler and leader of all the land and sea, purging them of injustice and lawlessness, and introducing justice and righteousness; and all this he did naked and by himself. And when Odysseus was shipwrecked and cast ashore, did his necessity make abject his spirit, or break it? Nay, but how did he advance upon the maidens to ask for food, which is regarded as being the most disgraceful thing for one person to ask of another?

#### Things to consider
1. Concern yourself with only whats in your control. 
2. Should we rely on others or fate for our misfortunes ?
3. Should people be concerned about conventional morals and norms when their necessities are not being met. 
4. Living a life of virtue and dignity is not an easy process so do whatever you have to protect your progress.
5. We fail to realise what is in our control and what is not 
6. Does poverty mean wealth in traditional sense or does it mean virtues or morals or rightesness
7. Misfortunes like "poor me" etc 
8. Is wealth moral and is moral wealth
9. Inner well being is to align fate/circumstances and be content with it or find happiness in it. [Unconventional wealth]

>The Acquisitive Society—Basis for the Having Mode
Our judgments are extremely biased because we live in a society that rests
on private property, profit, and power as the pillars of its existence. To
acquire, to own, and to make a profit are the sacred and unalienable rights
of the individual in the industrial society.* What the sources of property
are does not matter; nor does possession impose any obligations on the
property owners. The principle is: "Where and how my property was
acquired or what I do with it is nobody's business but my own; as long as
I do not violate the law, my right is unrestricted and absolute."
This kind of property may be called private property (from Latin privare,
"to deprive of"), because the person or persons who own it are its sole
masters, with full power to deprive others of its use or enjoyment. While
private ownership is supposed to be a natural and universal category, it is
in fact an exception rather than the rule if we consider the whole of
human history (including prehistory), and particularly the cultures outside
Europe in which economy was not life's main concern. Aside from private
property, there are: self-created property, which is exclusively the result of
one's own work; restricted property, which is restricted by the obligation to
>
> help one's fellow beings; functional, or personal, property, which consists
either of tools for work or of objects for enjoyment; common property,
which a group shares in the spirit of a common bond, such as the Israeli
kibbutzim.
The norms by which society functions also mold the character of its
members (social character). In an industrial society these are: the wish to
acquire property, to keep it, and to increase it, i.e., to make a profit, and
those who own property are admired and envied as superior beings. But
the vast majority of people own no property in a real sense of capital and
capital goods, and the puzzling question arises: How can such people fulfill
or even cope with their passion for acquiring and keeping property, or how
can they feel like owners of property when they haven't any property to
speak of?
Of course, the obvious answer is that even people who are property poor
own something—and they cherish their little possessions as much as the
owners of capital cherish their property. And like the big property owners,
the poor are obsessed by the wish to preserve what they do have and to
increase it, even though by an infinitesimal amount (for instance by saving
a penny here, two cents there).
Perhaps the greatest enjoyment is not so much in owning material
things but in owning living beings. In a patriarchal society even the most
miserable of men in the poorest of classes can be an owner of property—in
his relationship to his wife, his children, his animals, over whom he can
feel he is absolute master. At least for the man in a patriarchal society,
having many children is the only way to own persons without needing to
work to attain ownership, and without capital investment. Considering
that the whole burden of childbearing is the woman's, it can hardly be
denied that the production of children in a patriarchal society is a matter
of crude exploitation of women. In turn, however, the mothers have their
own form of ownership, that of the children when they are small. The
circle is endless and vicious: the husband exploits the wife, she exploits the
small children, and the adolescent males soon join the elder men in
exploiting the women, and so on.
The male hegemony in a patriarchal order has lasted roughly six or
seven millennia and still prevails in the poorest countries or among the
poorest classes of society. It is, however, slowly diminishing in the more
affluent countries or societies—emancipation of women, children, and
adolescents seems to take place when and to the degree that a society's
standard of living rises. With the slow collapse of the old-fashioned,
>
> patriarchal type of ownership of persons, wherein will the average and the
poorer citizens of the fully developed industrial societies now find fulfillment of their passion for acquiring, keeping, and increasing property? The
answer lies in extending the area of ownership to include friends, lovers,
health, travel, art objects, God, one's own ego. A brilliant picture of the
bourgeois obsession with property is given by Max Stirner. Persons are
transformed into things; their relations to each other assume the character
of ownership. "Individualism," which in its positive sense means liberation
from social chains, means, in the negative sense, "self-ownership," the
right—and the duty—to invest one's energy in the success of one's own
person.
Our ego is the most important object of our property feeling, for it
comprises many things: our body, our name, our social status, our
possessions (including our knowledge), the image we have of ourselves
and the image we want others to have of us. Our ego is a mixture of real
qualities, such as knowledge and skills, and of certain fictitious qualities
that we build around a core of reality. But the essential point is not so
much what the ego's content is, but that the ego is felt as a thing we each
possess, and that this "thing" is the basis of our sense of identity.
This discussion of property must take into account that an important
form of property attachment that flourished in the nineteenth century has
been diminishing in the decades since the end of the First World War and
is little evident today. In the older period, everything one owned was
cherished, taken care of, and used to the very limits of its utility. Buying
was "keep-it" buying, and a motto for the nineteenth century might well
have been: "Old is beautiful!" Today, consumption is emphasized, not
preservation, and buying has become "throw-away" buying. Whether the
object one buys is a car, a dress, a gadget, after using it for some time, one
gets tired of it and is eager to dispose of the "old" and buy the latest model.
Acquisition transitory having and using throwing away (or if
possible, profitable exchange for a better model) --> new acquisition,
constitutes the vicious circle of consumer-buying and today's motto could
indeed be: "New is beautiful!"
Perhaps the most striking example of today's consumer-buying phenomenon is the private automobile. Our age deserves to be dubbed "the age of
the automobile," for our whole economy has been built around automobile production, and our whole life is greatly determined by the rise and
fall of the consumer market for cars.
>
> To those who have one, their car seems like a vital necessity; to those
who do not yet own one, especially people in the so-called socialist states,
a car is a symbol of joy. Apparently, however, affection for one's car is not
deep and abiding, but a love affair of somewhat short duration, for owners
change their cars frequently; after two years, even after just one, an auto
owner tires of the "old car" and starts shopping around for a "good deal" on
a new vehicle. From shopping around to purchase, the whole transaction
seems to be a game in which even trickery is sometimes a prime element,
and the "good deal" is enjoyed as much as, if not more than, the ultimate
prize: that brand-new model in the driveway.
Several factors must be taken into account in order to solve the puzzle
of the seemingly flagrant contradiction between the owners' property
relationship to their automobiles and their so-short-lived interest in them.
First, there is the element of depersonalization in the owner's relationship
to the car; the car is not a concrete object that its owner is fond of, but a
status symbol, an extension of power—an ego builder; having acquired a
car, the owner has actually acquired a new piece of ego. A second factor is
that buying a new car every two years instead of, say, every six increases
the buyer's thrill of acquisition; the act of making the new car one's own
is a kind of defloration—it enhances one's sense of control, and the more
often it happens, the more thrilled one is. The third factor is that frequent
car buying means frequent opportunities to "make a deal"—to make a
profit by the exchange—a satisfaction deeply rooted in men and women
today. The fourth factor is one of great importance: the need to experience
new stimuli, because the old stimuli are flat and exhausted after but a short
while. In an earlier discussion of stimuli (The Anatomy of Human Destructiveness), I differentiated between "activating" and "passivating" stimuli and
suggested the following formulation: "The more 'passivating' a stimulus is,
the more frequently it must be changed in intensity and/or in kind; the
more 'activating' it is, the longer it retains its stimulating quality and the
less necessary is change in intensity and content." The fifth and most
important factor lies in the change in social character that has occurred
during the past century and a half, i.e., from the "hoarding" to the
"marketing" character. While the change does not do away with the
having orientation, it does modify it considerably. (This development of
the marketing character is discussed in Chapter VII.)
The proprietary feeling also shows up in other relationships, for example
toward doctors, dentists, lawyers, bosses, workers. People express it in
speaking of "my doctor," "my dentist," "my workers," and so on. But aside
>
> from their property attitude toward other human beings, people experience an unending number of objects, even feelings, as property. Take
health and illness, for example. People who discuss their health do so with
a proprietary feeling, referring to their sicknesses, their operations, their
treatments—their diets, their medicines. They clearly consider that health
and sickness are property; their property relationship to their bad health is
analogous, say, to that of a stockholder whose shares are losing part of their
original value in a badly falling market.
Ideas and beliefs can also become property, as can even habits. For
instance, anyone who eats an identical breakfast at the same time each
morning can be disturbed by even a slight change in that routine, because
his habit has become a property whose loss endangers his security.
The picture of the universality of the having mode of existence may
strike many readers as too negative and one-sided; and indeed it is. I
wanted to portray the socially prevalent attitude first in order to give as
clear a picture as possible. But there is another element that can give this
picture a degree of balance, and that is a growing attitude among the
young generation that is quite different from the majority. Among these
young people we find patterns of consumption that are not hidden forms
of acquisition and having, but expressions of genuine joy in doing what
one likes to do without expecting anything "lasting" in return. These
young people travel long distances, often with hardships, to hear music
they like, to see a place they want to see, to meet people they want to
meet. Whether their aims are as valuable as they think they are is not the
question here; even if they are without sufficient seriousness, preparation,
or concentration, these young people dare to be, and they are not
interested in what they get in return or what they can keep. They also
seem much more sincere than the older generation, although often
philosophically and politically naive. They do not polish their egos all the
time in order to be a desirable "object" on the market. They do not protect
their image by constantly lying, with or without knowing it; they do not
expend their energy in repressing truth, as the majority does. And
frequently, they impress their elders by their honesty—for their elders
secretly admire people who can see or tell the truth. Among them are
politically and religiously oriented groups of all shadings, but also many
without any particular ideology or doctrine who may say of themselves
that they are just "searching." While they may not have found themselves,
or a goal that gives guidance to the practice of life, they are searching to be
themselves instead of having and consuming.
>
> This positive element in the picture needs to be qualified, however.
Many of these same young people (and their number has been markedly
decreasing since the late sixties) had not progressed from freedom from to
freedom to; they simply rebelled without attempting to find a goal toward
which to move, except that of freedom from restrictions and dependence.
Like that of their bourgeois parents, their motto was "New is beautiful!"
and they developed an almost phobic disinterest in all tradition, including
the thoughts that the greatest minds have produced. In a kind of naïve
narcissism they believed that they could discover by themselves all that is
worth discovering. Basically, their ideal was to become small children
again, and such authors as Marcuse produced the convenient ideology that
return to childhood—not development to maturity—is the ultimate goal of
socialism and revolution. They were happy as long as they were young
enough for this euphoria to last; but many of them have passed this period
with severe disappointment, without having acquired well-founded convictions, without a center within themselves. They often end up as
disappointed, apathetic persons—or as unhappy fanatics of destruction.
Not all who had started with great hopes ended up with disappointment,
however, but it is unfortunately impossible to know what their number is.
To my knowledge, no valid statistical data or sound estimates are available,
and even if they were available, it is almost impossible to be sure how to
qualify the individuals. Today, millions of people in America and Europe
try to find contact with tradition and with teachers who can show them
the way. But in large part the doctrines and teachers are either fraudulent,
or vitiated by the spirit of public relations ballyhoo, or mixed up with the
financial and prestige interests of the respective gurus. Some people may
genuinely benefit from such methods in spite of the sham; others will
apply them without any serious intention of inner change. But only a
detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis of the new believers could
show how many belong to each group.
My personal estimate is that the young people (and some older ones)
who are seriously concerned with changing from the having to the being
mode number more than a few dispersed individuals. I believe that quite
a large number of groups and individuals are moving in the direction of
being, that they represent a new trend transcending the having orientation
of the majority, and that they are of historical significance. It will not be the
first time in history that a minority indicates the course that historical
development will take. The existence of this minority gives hope for the
general change in attitude from having to being. This hope is all the more
>
> real since some of the factors that made it possible for these new attitudes
to emerge are historical changes that can hardly be reversed: the breakdown of patriarchal supremacy over women and of parents' domination of
the young. While the political revolution of the twentieth century, the
Russian revolution, has failed (it is too early to judge the final outcome of
the Chinese revolution), the victorious revolutions of our century, even
though they are only in their first stages, are the women's, the children's,
and the sexual revolutions. Their principles have already been accepted by
the consciousness of a great many individuals, and every day the old
ideologies become more ridiculous.
The Nature of Having
The nature of the having mode of existence follows from the nature of
private property. In this mode of existence all that matters is my acquisition
of property and my unlimited right to keep what I have acquired. The
having mode excludes others; it does not require any further effort on my
part to keep my property or to make productive use of it. The Buddha has
described this mode of behavior as craving, the Jewish and Christian
religions as coveting; it transforms everybody and everything into something dead and subject to another's power.
The sentence "I have something" expresses the relation between the
subject, I (or he, we, you, they), and the object, O. It implies that the
subject is permanent and the object is permanent. But is there permanence
in the subject? Or in the object? I shall die; I may lose the social position
that guarantees my having something. The object is similarly not permanent: it can be destroyed, or it can be lost, or it can lose its value. Speaking
of having something permanently rests upon the illusion of a permanent
and indestructible substance. If I seem to have everything, I have—in
reality—nothing, since my having, possessing, controlling an object is only
a transitory moment in the process of living.
In the last analysis, the statement "/ [subject] have 0 [object]" expresses
a definition of I through my possession of O. The subject is not myself but
I am what I have. My property constitutes myself and my identity. The
underlying thought in the statement "I am I" is "I am I because I have X"—X
equaling all natural objects and persons to whom I relate myself through
my power to control them, to make them permanently mine
In the having mode, there is no alive relationship between me and what
I have. It and I have become things, and I have it, because I have the force
> 
> to make it mine. But there is also a reverse relationship: it has me, because
my sense of identity, i.e., of sanity, rests upon my having it (and as many
things as possible). The having mode of existence is not established by an
alive, productive process between subject and object; it makes things of
both object and subject. The relationship is one of deadness, not aliveness.
Having—Force—Rebellion
The tendency to grow in terms of their own nature is common to all living
beings. Hence we resist any attempt to prevent our growing in the ways
determined by our structure. In order to break this resistance, whether it
is conscious or not, physical or mental force is necessary. Inanimate objects
resist control of their physical composition in various degrees through the
energy inherent in their atomic and molecular structures. But they do not
fight against being used. The use of heteronomous force with living beings
(i.e., the force that tends to bend us in directions contrary to our given
structure and that is detrimental to our growth) arouses resistance. This
resistance can take all forms, from overt, effective, direct, active resistance
to indirect, ineffectual, and, very often, unconscious resistance.
What is restricted is the free, spontaneous expression of the infant's, the
child's, the adolescent's, and eventually the adult's will, their thirst for
knowledge and truth, their wish for affection. The growing person is forced
to give up most of his or her autonomous, genuine desires and interests,
and his or her own will, and to adopt a will and desires and feelings that
are not autonomous but superimposed by the social patterns of thought
and feeling. Society, and the family as its psychosocial agent, has to solve
a difficult problem: How to break a person's will without his being aware of it?
Yet by a complicated process of indoctrination, rewards, punishments, and
fitting ideology, it solves this task by and large so well that most people
believe they are following their own will and are unaware that their will
itself is conditioned and manipulated.
The greatest difficulty in this suppression of the will exists with regard to
sexuality, because we deal here with a strong tendency of the natural order
that is less easy to manipulate than many other desires. For this reason
people try harder to fight their sexual desires than almost any other
human desire. No need to cite the various forms of the vilification of sex
from moral grounds (its evilness) to health grounds (masturbation does
physical harm). The church had to forbid birth control and extramarital
>
> sex, and it still sticks to these principles even today when prudence would
recommend a more tolerant course.
The effort made to suppress sex would be beyond our understanding if
it were for the sake of sex as such. Not sex, however, but the breaking of
human will is the reason for vilifying sex. A great number of the so-called
primitive societies have no sex tabu whatever. Since they function without
exploitation and domination, they do not have to break the individual's
will. They can afford not to stigmatize sex and to enjoy the pleasure of
sexual relations without guilt feelings. Most remarkable in these societies
is that this sexual freedom does not lead to sexual greed; that after a period
of relatively transient sexual relations couples find each other; that they
then have no desire to swap partners, but are also free to separate when
love has gone. For these not-property-oriented groups sexual enjoyment is
an expression of being, not the result of sexual possessiveness. In saying
this I do not imply that we should return to living as these primitive
societies do—not that we could, even if we wanted to, for the simple
reason that the process of individuation and individual differentiation and
distance that civilization has brought about gives individual love a different
quality from that in primitive society. We cannot regress; we can only
move forward. What matters is that new forms of propertylessness will do
away with the sexual greed that is characteristic of all having societies.
Sexual desire is one expression of independence that is expressed very
early in life (masturbation). Its denunciation serves to break the will of the
child and make it feel guilty, and thus more submissive. To a large extent
the impulse to break sexual tabus is essentially an attempt at rebellion
aimed at restoring one's freedom. But the breaking of sexual tabus as such
does not lead to greater freedom; the rebellion is drowned, as it were, in
the sexual satisfaction . . . and in the person's subsequent guilt. Only the
achievement of inner independence is conducive to freedom and ends the
need for fruitless rebellion. The same holds true for all other behavior that
aims at doing the forbidden as an attempt to restore one's freedom. Indeed,
tabus create sexual obsessiveness and perversions, but sexual obsessiveness and
perversions do not create freedom.
The rebellion of the child manifests itself in many other ways: by the
child's not accepting the rules of cleanliness training; by not eating, or by
overeating; by aggression and sadism, and by many kinds of self-destructive acts. Often the rebellion manifests itself in a kind of general "slowdown strike"—a withdrawal of interest in the world, laziness, passivity, up
>
> to the most pathological forms of slow self-destruction. The effects of this
power struggle between children and parents is the subject of David E.
Schecter's paper on "Infant Development." All data indicate that heteronomous interference with the child's and the later person's growth process is the
deepest root of mental pathology, especially of destructiveness.
It must be clearly understood, though, that freedom is not laissez-faire
and arbitrariness. Human beings have a specific structure—like any other
species—and can grow only in terms of this structure. Freedom does not
mean freedom from all guiding principles. It means the freedom to grow
according to the laws of the structure of human existence (autonomous
restrictions). It means obedience to the laws that govern optimal human
development. Any authority that furthers this goal is "rational authority"
when this furtherance is achieved by way of helping to mobilize the child's
activity, critical thinking, and faith in life. It is "irrational authority" when
it imposes on the child heteronomous norms that serve the purposes of the
authority, but not the purposes of the child's specific structure.
The having mode of existence, the attitude centered on property and
profit, necessarily produces the desire—indeed the need—for power. To
control other living human beings we need to use power to break their
resistance. To maintain control over private property we need to use power
to protect it from those who would take it from us because they, like us,
can never have enough; the desire to have private property produces the
desire to use violence in order to rob others in overt or covert ways. In the
having mode, one's happiness lies in one's superiority over others, in one's
power, and in the last analysis, in one's capacity to conquer, rob, kill. In the
being mode it lies in loving, sharing, giving.
Other Factors Supporting the Having Mode
Language is an important factor in fortifying the having orientation. The
name of a person—and we all have names (and maybe numbers if the
present-day trend toward depersonalization continues)—creates the illusion that he or she is a final, immortal being. The person and the name
become equivalent; the name demonstrates that the person is a lasting,
indestructible substance—and not a process. Common nouns have the
same function: i.e., love, pride, hate, joy give the appearance of fixed
substances, but such nouns have no reality and only obscure the insight
that we are dealing with processes going on in a human being. But even
>
> nouns that are names of things, such as "table" or "lamp," are misleading.
The words indicate that we are speaking of fixed substances, although
things are nothing but a process of energy that causes certain sensations in
our bodily system. But these sensations are not perceptions of specific things
like table or lamp; these perceptions are the result of a cultural process of
learning, a process that makes certain sensations assume the form of
specific percepts. We naively believe that things like tables and lamps exist
as such, and we fail to see that society teaches us to transform sensations
into perceptions that permit us to manipulate the world around us in order
to enable us to survive in a given culture. Once we have given such
percepts a name, the name seems to guarantee the final and unchangeable
reality of the percept.
The need to have has still another foundation, the biologically given desire
to live. Whether we are happy or unhappy, our body impels us to strive for
immortality. But since we know by experience that we shall die, we seek for
solutions that make us believe that, in spite of the empirical evidence, we
are immortal. This wish has taken many forms: the belief of the Pharaohs
that their bodies enshrined in the pyramids would be immortal; many
religious fantasies of life after death, in the happy hunting grounds of early
hunter societies; the Christian and Islam paradise. In contemporary society
since the eighteenth century, "history" and "the future" have become the
substitutes for the Christian heaven: fame, celebrity, even notoriety—anything that seems to guarantee a footnote in the record of history—constitutes a bit of immortality. The craving for fame is not just secular
vanity—it has a religious quality for those who do not believe in the
traditional hereafter any more. (This is particularly noticeable among
political leaders.) Publicity paves the way to immortality, and the public
relations agents become the new priests.
But perhaps more than anything else, possession of property constitutes
the fulfillment of the craving for immortality, and it is for this reason that
the having orientation has such strength. If my self is constituted by what
I have, then I am immortal if the things I have are indestructible. From
Ancient Egypt to today—from physical immortality, via mummification of
the body, to mental immortality, via the last will—people have remained
alive beyond their physical/mental lifetimes. Via the legal power of the last
will the disposal of our property is determined for generations to come;
through the laws of inheritance, I—inasmuch as I am an owner of
capital—become immortal.
>
> The Having Mode and the Anal Character
A helpful approach to understanding the mode of having is to recall one of
Freud's most significant findings, that after going through their infant
phase of mere passive receptivity followed by a phase of aggressive
exploitative receptivity, all children, before they reach maturity, go
through a phase Freud designated the anal-erotic. Freud discovered that
this phase often remains dominant during a person's development, and
that when it does it leads to the development of the anal character, i.e., the
character of a person whose main energy in life is directed toward having,
saving, and hoarding money and material things as well as feelings,
gestures, words, energy. It is the character of the stingy individual and is
usually connected with such other traits as orderliness, punctuality,
stubbornness, each to a more than ordinary degree. An important aspect of
Freud's concept is the symbolic connection between money and feces
—gold and dirt—of which he quotes a number of examples. His concept of
the anal character as one that has not reached maturity is in fact a sharp
criticism of bourgeois society of the nineteenth century, in which the
qualities of the anal character constituted the norm for moral behavior and
were looked upon as the expression of "human nature." Freud's equation:
money = feces, is an implicit, although not intended, criticism of the
functioning of bourgeois society and its possessiveness and may be
compared with Marx's discussion of money in the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts.
It is of little importance in this context that Freud believed that a special
phase of the libido development was primary and that the character
formation was secondary (while in my opinion it is the product of the
interpersonal constellation in one's early life and, most of all, the social
conditions conducive to its formation). What matters is Freud's view that
the predominant orientation in possession occurs in the period before the achievement of full maturity and is pathological if it remains permanent. For Freud, in
other words, the person exclusively concerned with having and possession
is a neurotic, mentally sick person; hence it would follow that the society
in which most of the members are anal characters is a sick society.
Asceticism and Equality
Much of the moral and political discussion has centered on the question:
To have or not to have? On the moral-religious level this meant the
alternative between the ascetic life and the nonascetic life, the latter
>
> including both productive enjoyment and unlimited pleasure. This alternative loses most of its meaning if one's emphasis is not on the single act of
behavior but on the attitude underlying it. Ascetic behavior, with its
constant preoccupation with nonenjoyment, may be only the negation of
strong desires for having and consuming. In the ascetic these desires can be
repressed, yet in the very attempt to suppress having and consuming, the
person may be equally preoccupied with having and consuming. This
denial by over-compensation is, as psychoanalytic data show, very frequent. It occurs in such cases as fanatical vegetarians repressing destructive
impulses, fanatical antiabortionists repressing their murderous impulses,
fanatics of "virtue" repressing their own "sinful" impulses. What matters
here is not a certain conviction as such, but the fanaticism that supports it.
This, like all fanaticism, suggests the suspicion that it serves to cover other,
and usually the opposite, impulses.
In the economic and political field a similar erroneous alternative is
between unrestricted inequality and absolute equality of income. If
everybody's possessions are functional and personal, then whether someOne has somewhat more than another person does not constitute a social
problem, for since possession is not essential, envy does not grow. On the
other hand, those who are concerned with equality in the sense that each
one's share must be exactly equal to anyone else's show that their own
having orientation is as strong as ever, except that it is denied by their
preoccupation with exact equality. Behind this concern their real motivation is visible: envy. Those demanding that nobody should have more than
themselves are thus protecting themselves from the envy they would feel
if anyone had even an ounce more of anything. What matters is that both
luxury and poverty shall be eradicated; equality must not mean the
quantitative equality of each morsel of material goods, but that income is
not differentiated to a point that creates different experiences of life for
different groups. In the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts, Marx
pointed this out in what he calls "crude communism," which "negates the
personality of man in every sphere"; this type of communism "is only the
culmination of such envy and leveling-down on the basis of a preconceived minimum."
Existential Having
In order to fully appreciate the mode of having that we are dealing with
here, yet another qualification seems necessary, that of the function of
> 
>existential having; for human existence requires that we have, keep, take
care of, and use certain things in order to survive. This holds true for our
bodies, for food, shelter, clothing, and for the tools necessary to produce
our needs. This form of having may be called existential having because it
is rooted in human existence. It is a rationally directed impulse in the
pursuit of staying alive—in contrast to the characterological having we have
been dealing with so far, which is a passionate drive to retain and keep that
is not innate, but that has developed as the result of the impact of social
conditions on the human species as it is biologically given.
Existential having is not in conflict with being; characterological having
necessarily is. Even the "just" and the "saintly," inasmuch as they are
human, must want to have in the existential sense—while the average
person wants to have in the existential and in the characterological sense.
(See the earlier discussion of existential and characterological dichotomies
in Man for Himself.)

#### Things to consider
1. Our interpretations of conventional wealth depends on the socital norms
2. We define what is important to us, often those with wealth and convenience consider it a necessity akin to infatuation. Link to material wealth.
3. where they just move on to another once it becomes obsolete or "less than ideal". Seen as status symbol, the affection and fondness is due to ego. -> Wealth as a stimulus .
4. People seek wealth as a stimulus ?
5. Hoarding, it extends to people as well, doctors, dentists, lawyers, chefs
6. Materialistic aims, what is good for my status and not for me alt. how people percieve me instead of my own well being. As such people have 
7.  Interests in increasing their material possessions. The act of purchasing more things, as already mentioned in the lesson above, didn’t lead to the so-desperately desired happiness. Completely the opposite happened – the ever-fleeting feeling of satisfaction emerged. "After all, there is constantly something new produced. Something new that is making your current things obsolete. The only time we experience joy, in a society praising possessions, is when we acquire more. But since more is constantly produced, we never feel enough. Thus, we want more, to feel more. It’s a never-ending cycle. Therefore, people can never be satisfied and there is never an end to our wishes. But this realization is not commonly recognized by people. We are sold on the idea that having is what truly matters for a happy life. That you need more to be more."

> Most of us know more about the mode of having than we do about the
mode of being, because having is by far the more frequently experienced
mode in our culture. But something more important than that makes
defining the mode of being so much more difficult than defining the mode
of having, namely the very nature of the difference between these two
modes of existence.
> 
> Having refers to things and things are fixed and describable. Being refers
to experience, and human experience is in principle not describable. What is
fully describable is our persona—the mask we each wear, the ego we
present—for this persona is in itself a thing. In contrast, the living human
being is not a dead image and cannot be described like a thing. In fact, the
living human being cannot be described at all. Indeed, much can be said
about me, about my character, about my total orientation to life. This
insightful knowledge can go very far in understanding and describing my
own or another's psychical structure. But the total me, my whole
individuality, my suchness that is as unique as my fingerprints are, can
never be fully understood, not even by empathy, for no two human beings
are entirely alike.* Only in the process of mutual alive relatedness can the
other and I overcome the barrier of separateness, inasmuch as we both
participate in the dance of life. Yet our full identification of each other can
never be achieved.
>
> Even a single act of behavior cannot be fully described. One could write
pages of description of the Mona Lisa's smile, and still the pictured smile
would not have been caught in words—but not because her smile is so
"mysterious." Everybody's smile is mysterious (unless it is the learned,
synthetic smile of the marketplace). No one can fully describe the
expression of interest, enthusiasm, biophilia, or of hate or narcissism that
one may see in the eyes of another person, or the variety of facial
expressions, of gaits, of postures, of intonations that exists among people.
> 
> Being Active
>
> The mode of being has as its prerequisites independence, freedom, and the
presence of critical reason. Its fundamental characteristic is that of being
active, not in the sense of outward activity, of busyness, but of inner
activity, the productive use of our human powers. To be active means to
give expression to one's faculties, talents, to the wealth of human gifts with
which—though in varying degrees—every human being is endowed. It
means to renew oneself, to grow, to flow out, to love, to transcend the
prison of one's isolated ego, to be interested, to "list," to give. Yet none of
these experiences can be fully expressed in words. The words are vessels
that are filled with experience that overflows the vessels. The words point
to an experience; they are not the experience. The moment that I express
what I experience exclusively in thought and words, the experience has
gone: it has dried up, is dead, a mere thought. Hence being is indescribable
in words and is communicable only by sharing my experience. In the
structure of having, the dead word rules; in the structure of being, the alive
and inexpressible experience rules. (Of course, in the being mode there is
also thinking that is alive and productive.)
Perhaps the being mode may best be described in a symbol suggested to
me by Max Hunziger: A blue glass appears to be blue when light shines
through it because it absorbs all other colors and thus does not let them
pass. This is to say, we call a glass "blue" precisely because it does not retain
the blue waves. It is named not for what it possesses but for what it gives
out.
>
> Only to the extent that we decrease the mode of having, that is of
nonbeing—i.e., stop finding security and identity by clinging to what we
have, by "sitting on it," by holding onto our ego and our possessions—can
the mode of being emerge. "To be" requires giving up one's egocentricity
>
> and selfishness, or in words often used by the mystics, by making oneself
"empty" and "poor."
But most people find giving up their having orientation too difficult; any
attempt to do so arouses their intense anxiety and feels like giving up all
security, like being thrown into the ocean when one does not know how
to swim. They do not know that when they have given up the crutch of
property, they can begin to use their own proper forces and walk by
themselves. What holds them back is the illusion that they could not walk
by themselves, that they would collapse if they were not supported by the
things they have. They are like the child who is afraid that it will never be
able to walk, after it has fallen the first time. But nature and human help
prevent human beings from becoming cripples. Those who believe that
they would collapse without using the crutches of having also need some
human help.
>
> Activity and Passivity'
>
> Being, in the sense we have described it, implies the faculty of being active;
passivity excludes being. However, "active" and "passive" are among the
most misunderstood words, because their meaning is completely different
today from what it was from classic antiquity and the Middle Ages to the
period beginning with the Renaissance. In order to understand the concept
of being, the concept of activity and passivity must be clarified.
In modern usage activity is usually defined as a quality of behavior that
brings about a visible effect by expenditure of energy. Thus, for instance,
farmers who cultivate their lands are called active; so are workers on
assembly lines, salespeople who persuade their customers to buy, investors
who invest their own or other people's money, physicians who treat their
patients, clerks who sell postage stamps, bureaucrats who file papers.
While some of these activities may require more interest and concentration than others, this does not matter with regard to "activity." Activity, by
and large, is socially recognized purposeful behavior that results in corresponding
socially useful changes.
>
> Activity in the modern sense refers only to behavior, not to the person
behind the behavior. It makes no difference whether people are active
because they are driven by external force, like a slave, or by internal
compulsion, like a person driven by anxiety. It does not matter whether
they are interested in their work, like a carpenter or a creative writer, or a
scientist or a gardener; or whether they have no inner relation to and
satisfaction in what they are doing, like the worker on the assembly line or
the postal clerk.
>
> The modern sense of activity makes no distinction between activity and
mere busyness. But there is a fundamental difference between the two that
corresponds to the terms "alienated" and "nonalienated" in respect to
activities. In alienated activity I do not experience myself as the acting
subject of my activity; rather, I experience the outcome of my activity—and
that as something "over there," separated from me and standing above and
against me. In alienated activity I do not really act; I am acted upon by
external or internal forces. I have become separated from the result of my
activity. The best observable case of alienated activity in the field of
psychopathology is that of compulsive-obsessional persons. Forced by an
inner urge to do something against their own wills—such as counting
steps, repeating certain phrases, performing certain private rituals—they
can be extremely active in the pursuit of this aim; but as psychoanalytic
investigation has amply shown, they are driven by an inner force that they
are unaware of. An equally clear example of alienated activity is posthypnotic behavior. Persons under hypnotic suggestion to do this or that
upon awakening from the hypnotic trance will do these things without
any awareness that they are not doing what they want to do, but are
following their respective hypnotists' previously given orders.
In nonalienated activity, I experience myself as the subject of my activity.
Nonalienated activity is a process of giving birth to something, of producing something and remaining related to what I produce. This also implies
that my activity is a manifestation of my powers, that I and my activity and
the result of my activity are one. I call this nonalienated activity productive
activity. 
>
> activity; it does not necessarily have a connection with the creation of a
work of art, of science, or of something "useful." Productiveness is a
character orientation all human beings are capable of, to the extent that
they are not emotionally crippled. Productive persons animate whatever
they touch. They give birth to their own faculties and bring life to other
persons and to things.
"Activity" and "passivity" can each have two entirely different meanings.
Alienated activity, in the sense of mere busyness, is actually "passivity," in
the sense of productivity; while passivity, in terms of nonbusyness, may be
nonalienated activity. This is so difficult to understand today because most
activity is alienated "passivity," while productive passivity is rarely experienced.
Activity—Passivity, According to the Masters of Thought
"Activity" and "passivity" were not used in the current sense in the
philosophical tradition of preindustrial society. They hardly could have
been, since the alienation of work had not reached a point comparable to
the one existing now. For this reason such philosophers as Aristotle do not
even make a clear-cut distinction between "activity" and mere "busyness."
In Athens, alienated work was done only by slaves; work which involved
bodily labor seems to have been excluded from the concept of praxis
("practice"), a term that refers only to almost any kind of activity a free
person is likely to perform, and essentially the term Aristotle used for a
person's free activity. (See Nicholas Lobkowicz, Theory and Practice.) Considering this background, the problem of subjectively meaningless, alienated, purely routinized work could hardly arise for free Athenians. Their
freedom implied precisely that because they were not slaves, their activity
was productive and meaningful to them.
That Aristotle did not share our present concepts of activity and passivity
becomes unmistakably clear if we will consider that for him the highest
form of praxis, i.e., of activity—even above political activity—is the
contemplative life, devoted to the search for truth. The idea that contemplation was a form of inactivity was unthinkable for him. Aristotle considers
contemplative life the activity of the best part in us, the nous. The slave can
enjoy sensuous pleasure, even as the free do. But eudaimonia, "well-being,"
consists not in pleasures but in activities in accordance with virtue (Nichomachean Ethics, 1177a, 2 ff.).
>
> Like Aristotle's, Thomas Aquinas' position is also in contrast to the
modern concept of activity. For Aquinas, too, the life devoted to inner
stillness and spiritual knowledge, the vita contemplativa, is the highest form
of human activity. He concedes that the daily life, the vita activa, of the
average person, is also valuable, and it leads to well-being (beatitudo),
provided—and this qualification is crucial—that the aim toward which all
one's activities are directed is well-being and that one is able to control
one's passions and one's body (Thomas Aquinas, Summa, 2-2:182, 183;
1-2:4,6).
>
> But the problem of the vita contemplativa and the vita activa goes far
beyond this point. For while Aquinas' attitude is one of a certain
compromise, the author of The Cloud of Unknowing, a contemporary of
Master Eckhart, argues sharply against the value of the active life, while
Eckhart, on the other hand, speaks out very much in favor of it. The
contradiction is not as sharp as it may appear, however, because all agree
that activity is "wholesome" only when it is rooted in and expresses the
ultimate ethical and spiritual demands. For this reason, for all these
teachers, busyness, i.e., activity separated from people's spiritual ground, is
to be rejected.
>
> These sentences are difficult for the modern reader, who is accustomed
to think that the term "human nature" does not correspond to any
demonstrable empirical data. But for Spinoza, as for Aristotle, this is not so;
nor is it for some contemporary neurophysiologists, biologists, and psychologists. Spinoza believes that human nature is as characteristic for
human beings as horse nature is for the horse; furthermore, that goodness
or badness, success or failure, well-being or suffering, activity or passivity
depend on the degree to which persons succeed in realizing the optimal
development of their own natures. Optimal realization of one's species
nature (in the case of people, human nature) is the goal of life; the closer
we arrive at the model of human nature, the greater are our freedom and
our well-being.
>
> Desires are divided into active and passive ones (actiones and passiones).
The former are rooted in the conditions of our existence (the natural and
not the pathological distortions), and the latter are not thus rooted but are
caused by inner or outer distorting conditions. The former exist to the
extent that we are free; the latter are caused by inner or outer force. All
"active affects" are necessarily good: "passions" can be good or evil.
According to Spinoza, activity, reason, freedom, well-being, joy, and selfperfection are inseparably connected—in the same way as passivity,
irrationality, bondage, sadness, powerlessness, and strivings contrary to the
demands of human nature are (Ethics, 4, app. 2, 3, 5; props. 40, 42).
One understands Spinoza's ideas about passions and passivity fully only
if one proceeds to the last—and most modern—step of his thinking: that to
be driven by irrational passions is to be mentally sick. To the degree that we
achieve optimal growth, we are not only (relatively) free, strong, rational,
and joyous but also mentally healthy; to the degree that we fail to reach
this aim, we are unfree, weak, lacking rationality, and depressed. Spinoza,
to my knowledge, was the first modern thinker to postulate that mental
health and sickness are outcomes of right and wrong living respectively.
>
 > For Spinoza mental health is, in the last analysis, a manifestation of right
living; mental illness, a symptom of the failure to live according to the
requirements of human nature. "But if the greedy person thinks only of
money and possessions, the ambitious one only of fame, one does not
think of them as being insane, but only as annoying; generally one has
contempt for them. But factually, greediness, ambition, and so forth are
forms of insanity, although usually one does not think of them as 'illness'
(Ethics, 4, prop. 44). In this statement, so foreign to the thinking of our
time, Spinoza considers passions that do not correspond to the needs of
human nature as pathological; in fact, he goes so far as to call them a form
of insanity.
Spinoza's concepts of activity and passivity are a most radical critique of
industrial society. In contrast to today's belief that persons driven mainly
by greed for money, possession, or fame are normal and well adjusted, they
are considered by Spinoza utterly passive and basically sick. The active
persons in Spinoza's sense, which he personified in his own life, have
become exceptions, and are somewhat suspected of being "neurotic"
because they are so little adapted to so-called normal activity.
Marx wrote (in the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts) that "free
conscious activity" (i.e., human activity) is "the species character of man."
Labor, for him, represents human activity, and human activity is life.
Capital, on the other hand, represents for Marx the amassed, the past, and
in the last analysis, the dead (Grundrisse). One cannot fully understand the
affective charge which the struggle between capital and labor had for Marx
unless one considers that for him it was the fight between aliveness and
deadness, the present versus the past, people versus things, being versus
having. For Marx the question was: Who should rule whom—should life
rule the dead, or the dead rule life? Socialism, for him, represented a
society in which life had won over the dead.
Marx's whole critique of capitalism and his vision of socialism are rooted
in the concept that human self-activity is paralyzed in the capitalist system
and that the goal is to restore full humanity by restoring activity in all
spheres of life.
Despite the formulations influenced by the classic economists, the cliché
that Marx was a determinist, making human beings the passive objects of
history and depriving them of their activity, is the very opposite of his
thinking, as any who themselves read Marx, rather than a few isolated
sentences taken out of context, will be easily convinced. Marx's views
could not be more clearly expressed than they are in his own statement:
"History does nothing; it possesses no colossal riches, it 'fights no fight.' It
is rather man—real, living man—who acts, possesses and fights everything. It is by no means 'History' which uses man as a means to carry out
its ends as if it were a person apart; rather History is nothing but the
activity of man in pursuit of his ends" (Marx and Engels, The Holy Family).
Of near contemporaries none has perceived the passive character of
modern activity as penetratingly as has Albert Schweitzer, who, in his study
of the decay and restoration of civilization, saw modern Man as unfree,
incomplete, unconcentrated, pathologically dependent, and "absolutely
passive."
>
> Being as Reality
Thus far I have described the meaning of being by contrasting it to having.
But a second, equally important meaning of being is revealed by contrasting it to appearing. If I appear to be kind while my kindness is only a mask
to cover my exploitativeness—if I appear to be courageous while I am
extremely vain or perhaps suicidal—if I appear to love my country while
I am furthering my selfish interests, the appearance, i.e., my overt
behavior, is in drastic contradiction to the reality of forces that motivate
me. My behavior is different from my character. My character structure,
the true motivation of my behavior, constitutes my real being. My
behavior may partly reflect my being, but it is usually a mask that I have
and that I wear for my own purposes. Behaviorism deals with this mask as
if it were a reliable scientific datum; true insight is focused on the inner
reality, which is usually neither conscious nor directly observable. This
concept of being as "unmasking," as is expressed by Eckhart, is central in
Spinoza's and Marx's thought and is the fundamental discovery of
Freud.
To understand the discrepancy between behavior and character,
between my mask and the reality it hides, is the main achievement of
Freud's psychoanalysis. He devised a method (free association, analysis of
dreams, transference, and resistance) that aimed at uncovering the instinctual (essentially sexual) desires that had been repressed in early childhood.
Even when later developments in psychoanalytic theory and therapy
proceeded to emphasize traumatic events in the field of early interpersonal
relations rather than of instinctual life, the principle remained the same:
What is repressed are early and—as I believe—later traumatic desires and
>
> fears; the way to recovery from symptoms or from a more general malaise
lies in uncovering this repressed material. In other words, what is
repressed are the irrational, infantile, and individual elements of experience.
On the other hand, the common-sense views of a normal, i.e., socially
adapted, citizen were supposed to be rational and not in need of depth
analysis. But this is not true at all. Our conscious motivations, ideas, and
beliefs are a blend of false information, biases, irrational passions, rationalizations, prejudices, in which morsels of truth swim around and give the
reassurance, albeit false, that the whole mixture is real and true. The
thinking process attempts to organize this whole cesspool of illusions
according to the laws of logic and plausibility. This level of consciousness is
supposed to reflect reality; it is the map we use for organizing our life. This
false map is not repressed. What is repressed is the knowledge of reality, the
knowledge of what is true. If we ask, then: What is unconscious? the answer
must be: Aside from irrational passions, almost the whole of knowledge of
reality. The unconscious is basically determined by society, which produces
irrational passions and provides its members with various kinds of fiction
and thus forces the truth to become the prisoner of the alleged rationality.
Stating that the truth is repressed is based, of course, on the premise that
we know the truth and repress this knowledge; in other words, that there
is "unconscious knowledge." My experience in psychoanalysis—of others
and of myself—is that this is indeed true. We perceive reality, and we
cannot help perceiving it. Just as our senses are organized to see, hear,
smell, touch when we are brought together with reality, our reason is
organized to recognize reality, i.e., to see things as they are, to perceive the
truth. I am not of course referring to the part of reality that requires
scientific tools or methods in order to be perceived. I am referring to what
is recognizable by concentrated "seeing," especially the reality in ourselves
and in others. We know when we meet a dangerous person, when we
meet somebody we can fully trust; we know when we are lied to, or
exploited, or fooled, when we have sold ourselves a bill of goods. We know
almost everything that is important to know about human behavior, just as
our ancestors had a remarkable knowledge about the movements of the
stars. But while they were aware of their knowledge and used it, we repress
our knowledge immediately, because if it were conscious it would make
life too difficult and, as we persuade ourselves, too "dangerous."
>
> The proof of this statement is easy to find. It exists in many dreams in
which we exhibit a deep insight into the essence of other people, and of
ourselves, which we completely lack in the daytime. (I included examples
of "insight dreams" in The Forgotten Language.) It is evidenced in those
frequent reactions in which we suddenly see somebody in an entirely
different light, and then feel as if we had had this knowledge all the time
before. It can be found in the phenomenon of resistance when the painful
truth threatens to come to the surface: in slips of the tongue, in awkward
expressions, in a state of trance, or in instances when a person says
something, as in an aside, that is the very opposite of what he or she
always claimed to believe, and then seems to forget this aside a minute
later. Indeed, a great deal of our energy is used to hide from ourselves what
we know, and the degree of such repressed knowledge can hardly be
overestimated. A Talmudic legend has expressed this concept of the
repression of the truth, in a poetic form: when a child is born, an angel
touches its head, so that it forgets the knowledge of the truth that it has at
the moment of birth. If the child did not forget, its life would become
unbearable.
Returning to our main thesis: Being refers to the real, in contrast to the
falsified, illusionary picture. In this sense, any attempt to increase the
sector of being means increased insight into the reality of one's self, of
others, of the world around us. The main ethical goals of Judaism and
Christianity—overcoming greed and hate—cannot be realized without
another factor that is central in Buddhism and also plays a role in Judaism
and in Christianity: The way to being is penetration through the surface
and insight into reality.
The Will to Give, to Share, to Sacrifice
In contemporary society the having mode of existing is assumed to be
rooted in human nature and, hence, virtually unchangeable. The same
idea is expressed in the dogma that people are basically lazy, passive by
nature, and that they do not want to work or to do anything else, unless
they are driven by the incentive of material gain . . . or hunger . . . or the
fear of punishment. This dogma is doubted by hardly anybody, and it
determines our methods of education and of work. But it is little more than
an expression of the wish to prove the value of our social arrangements by
imputing to them that they follow the needs of human nature. To the
members of many different societies of both past and present, the concept
>
> of innate human selfishness and laziness would appear as fantastic as the
reverse sounds to us.
The truth is that both the having and the being modes of existence are
potentialities of human nature, that our biological urge for survival tends
to further the having mode, but that selfishness and laziness are not the
only propensities inherent in human beings.
We human beings have an inherent and deeply rooted desire to be: to
express our faculties, to be active, to be related to others, to escape the
prison cell of selfishness. The truth of this statement is proven by so much
evidence that a whole volume could easily be filled with it. D. O. Hebb has
formulated the gist of the problem in the most general form by stating that
the only behavioral problem is to account for inactivity, not for activity. The
following data are evidence for this general thesis:*
1. The data on animal behavior. Experiments and direct observation
show that many species undertake difficult tasks with pleasure, even when
no material rewards are offered.
2. Neurophysiological experiments demonstrate the activity inherent in
the nerve cells.
3. Infantile behavior. Recent studies show the capacity and need of small
infants to respond actively to complicated stimuli—findings in contrast to
Freud's assumption that the infant experiences the outside stimulus as a
threat and that it mobilizes its aggressiveness in order to remove the
threat.
4. Learning behavior. Many studies show that the child and adolescent
are lazy because learning material is presented to them in a dry and dead
way that is incapable of arousing their genuine interest; if the pressure and
the boredom are removed and the material is presented in an alive way,
remarkable activity and initiative are mobilized.
5. Work behavior. E. Mayo's classic experiment has shown that even
work which in itself is boring becomes interesting if the workers know that
they are participating in an experiment conducted by an alive and gifted
person who has the capacity to arouse their curiosity and their participation. The same has been shown in a number of factories in Europe and in
the United States. The managers' stereotype of the workers is: workers are
not really interested in active participation; all they want are higher wages,
hence profit sharing might be an incentive for higher work productivity,

>
> but not the workers' participation. While the managers are right as far as
the work methods they offer are concerned, experience has shown—and
has convinced not a few managers—that if the workers can be truly active,
responsible, and knowledgeable in their work role, the formerly uninterested ones change considerably and show a remarkable degree of inventiveness, activity, imagination, and satisfaction.*
6. The wealth of data to be found in social and political life. The belief
that people do not want to make sacrifices is notoriously wrong. When
Churchill announced at the beginning of the Second World War that what
he had to demand from the British was blood, sweat, and tears, he did not
deter them, but on the contrary, he appealed to their deep-seated human
desire to make sacrifices, to give of themselves. The reaction of the
British—and of the Germans and the Russians as well—toward the
indiscriminate bombing of population centers by the belligerents proves
that common suffering did not weaken their spirit; it strengthened their
resistance and proved wrong those who believed terror bombing could
break the morale of the enemy and help finish the war.
It is a sad commentary on our civilization, however, that war and
suffering rather than peacetime living can mobilize human readiness to
make sacrifices, and that the times of peace seem mainly to encourage
selfishness. Fortunately, there are situations in peacetime in which human
strivings for giving and solidarity manifest themselves in individual behavior. The workers' strikes, especially up to the period of the First World War,
are an example of such essentially nonviolent behavior. The workers
sought higher wages, but at the same time, they risked and accepted severe
hardships in order to fight for their own dignity and the satisfaction of
experiencing human solidarity. The strike was as much a "religious" as an
economic phenomenon. While such strikes still do occur even today, most
present-day strikes are for economic reasons—although strikes for better
working conditions have increased recently.
The need to give and to share and the willingness to make sacrifices for
others are still to be found among the members of certain professions, such

>
> as nurses, physicians, monks, and nuns. The goal of helping and sacrificing
is given only lip service by many, if not most, of these professionals; yet the
character of a goodly number corresponds to the values they profess. We
find the same needs affirmed and expressed in many communes throughout the centuries, whether religious, socialist, or humanist. We find the
wish to give in the people who volunteer their blood (without payment),
in the many situations in which people risk their lives to save another's.
We find the manifestation of the will to give in people who genuinely love.
"False love," i.e., shared mutual selfishness, makes people more selfish
(and this is the case often enough). Genuine love increases the capacity to
love and to give to others. The true lover loves the whole world, in his or
her love for a specific person.*
Conversely, we find that not a few people, especially younger ones,
cannot stand the luxury and selfishness that surround them in their
affluent families. Quite against the expectations of their elders, who think
that their children "have everything they wish," they rebel against the
deadness and isolation of their lives. For the fact is, they do not have
everything they wish and they wish for what they do not have.
Outstanding examples of such people from past history are the sons and
daughters of the rich in the Roman Empire, who embraced the religion of
poverty and love; another is the Buddha, who was a prince and had every
pleasure and luxury that he could possibly want, but discovered that
having and consuming cause unhappiness and suffering. A more recent
example (second half of the nineteenth century) is the sons and daughters
of the Russian upper class, the Narodniki. Finding themselves no longer
able to stand the life of idleness and injustice they had been born into,
these young people left their families and joined the poor peasants, lived
with them, and helped to lay one of the foundations of the revolutionary
struggle in Russia.
>
> We can witness a similar phenomenon among the sons and daughters of
the well-to-do in the United States and Germany, who see their life in their
One of the most important sources for understanding the natural human
impulse to give and to share is P. A. Kropotkin's classic, Mutual Aid: A Factor of
Evolution (1902). Two other important works are The Gift Relationship: From Human
Blood to Social Policy by Richard Titmuss (in which he points to the manifestations
of the people's wish to give, and stresses that our economic system prevents
people from freely exercising their right to give), and Edmund S. Phelps, ed.,
Altruism, Morality and Economic Theory.

> affluent home environment as boring and meaningless. But more than
that, they find the world's callousness toward the poor and the drift toward
nuclear war for the sake of individual egotism unbearable. Thus, they
move away from their home environment, looking for a new lifestyle—and remain unsatisfied because no constructive effort seems to have
a chance. Many among them were originally the most idealistic and
sensitive of the young generation; but at this point, lacking in tradition,
maturity, experience, and political wisdom, they become desperate, narcissistically overestimate their own capacities and possibilities, and try to
achieve the impossible by the use of force. They form so-called revolutionary groups and expect to save the world by acts of terror and
destruction, not seeing that they are only contributing to the general
tendency to violence and inhumanity. They have lost their capacity to love
and have replaced it with the wish to sacrifice their lives. (Self-sacrifice is
frequently the solution for individuals who ardently desire to love, but
who have lost the capacity to love and see in the sacrifice of their own lives
an experience of love in the highest degree.) But these self-sacrificing
young people are very different from the loving martyrs, who want to live
because they love life and who accept death only when they are forced to
die in order not to betray themselves. Our present-day self-sacrificing
young people are the accused, but they are also the accusers, in demonstrating that in our social system some of the very best young people
become so isolated and hopeless that nothing but destruction and fanaticism are left as a way out of their despair.
The human desire to experience union with others is rooted in the
specific conditions of existence that characterize the human species and is
one of the strongest motivators of human behavior. By the combination of
minimal instinctive determination and maximal development of the
capacity for reason, we human beings have lost our original oneness with
nature. In order not to feel utterly isolated—which would, in fact,
condemn us to insanity—we need to find a new unity: with our fellow
beings and with nature. This human need for unity with others is
experienced in many ways: in the symbiotic tie to mother, an idol, one's
tribe, one's nation, one's class, one's religion, one's fraternity, one's
professional organization. Often, of course, these ties overlap, and often
they assume an ecstatic form, as among members of certain religious sects
or of a lynch mob, or in the outbursts of national hysteria in the case of
war. The outbreak of the First World War, for example, occasioned one of
the most drastic of these ecstatic forms of "union." Suddenly, from one day

> to the next, people gave up their lifelong convictions of pacifism, antimilitarism, socialism; scientists threw away their lifelong training in
objectivity, critical thinking, and impartiality in order to join the big We.
The desire to experience union with others manifests itself in the lowest
kind of behavior, i.e., in acts of sadism and destruction, as well as in the
highest: solidarity on the basis of an ideal or conviction. It is also the main
cause of the need to adapt; human beings are more afraid of being outcasts
than even of dying. Crucial to every society is the kind of union and
solidarity it fosters and the kind it can further, under the given conditions
of its socioeconomic structure.
>
> These considerations seem to indicate that both tendencies are present
in human beings: the one, to have—to possess—that owes its strength in
the last analysis to the biological factor of the desire for survival; the other,
to be—to share, to give, to sacrifice—that owes its strength to the specific
conditions of human existence and the inherent need to overcome one's
isolation by oneness with others. From these two contradictory strivings in
every human being it follows that the social structure, its values and
norms, decides which of the two becomes dominant. Cultures that foster
the greed for possession, and thus the having mode of existence, are rooted
in one human potential; cultures that foster being and sharing are rooted
in the other potential. We must decide which of these two potentials we
want to cultivate, realizing, however, that our decision is largely determined by the socioeconomic structure of our given society that inclines us
toward one or the other solution.
From my observations in the field of group behavior my best guess is
that the two extreme groups, respectively manifesting deeply ingrained
and almost unalterable types of having and of being, form a small minority;
that in the vast majority both possibilities are real, and which of the two
becomes dominant and which is repressed depends on environmental
factors.
>
>This assumption contradicts a widely held psychoanalytic dogma that
environment produces essential changes in personality development in
infancy and early childhood, but that after this period the character is fixed
and hardly changed by external events. This psychoanalytic dogma has
been able to gain acceptance because the basic conditions of their childhood continue into most people's later life, since in general, the same social
conditions continue to exist. But numerous instances exist in which a
drastic change in environment leads to a fundamental change in behavior, i.e., when the negative forces cease to be fed and the positive forces are
nurtured and encouraged.
>
> To sum up, the frequency and intensity of the desire to share, to give,
and to sacrifice are not surprising if we consider the conditions of existence
of the human species. What is surprising is that this need could be so
repressed as to make acts of selfishness the rule in industrial (and many
other) societies and acts of solidarity the exception. But, paradoxically, this
very phenomenon is caused by the need for union. A society whose
principles are acquisition, profit, and property produces a social character
oriented around having, and once the dominant pattern is established,
nobody wants to be an outsider, or indeed an outcast; in order to avoid this
risk everybody adapts to the majority, who have in common only their
mutual antagonism.
As a consequence of the dominant attitude of selfishness, the leaders of
our society believe that people can be motivated only by the expectation of
material advantages, i.e., by rewards, and that they will not react to
appeals for solidarity and sacrifice. Hence, except in times of war, these
appeals are rarely made, and the chances to observe the possible results of
such appeals are lost.
Only a radically different socioeconomic structure and a radically
different picture of human nature could show that bribery is not the only
way (or the best way) to influence people.
