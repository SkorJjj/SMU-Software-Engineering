# Big Questions - Wealth and Poverty 
## Week 1
### Epictetus (1925) - The disclosures book [ To those who fear want ]


> Does a good man fear that food will fail him? It does not fail the blind, it does not fail the lame; will it fail a good man? A good soldier does not lack someone to give him pay, or a workman, or a cobbler; and shall a good man?[5] Does God so neglect His own creatures, His servants, His witnesses, whom alone He uses as examples to the uninstructed, to prove that He both is, and governs the universe well, and does not neglect the affairs of men, and that no evil befalls a good man either in life or in death?[6]—Yes, but what if He does not provide food?—Why, what else but that as a good general He has sounded the recall? I obey, I follow, lauding my commander, and singing hymns of praise about His deeds. 30For I came into the world when it so pleased Him, and I leave it again at His pleasure, and while I live this was my function—to sing hymns of praise unto God, to myself and to others, be it to one or to many. God does not give me much, no abundance. He does not want me to live luxuriously; He did not give much to Heracles, either, though he was His own son, but someone else was king over Argos and Mycenae, while he was subject, and suffered labours and discipline. And Eurystheus, such as he was, was not king over either Argos or Mycenae, for he was not king even over himself; but Heracles was ruler and leader of all the land and sea, purging them of injustice and lawlessness, and introducing justice and righteousness; and all this he did naked and by himself. And when Odysseus was shipwrecked and cast ashore, did his necessity make abject his spirit, or break it? Nay, but how did he advance upon the maidens to ask for food, which is regarded as being the most disgraceful thing for one person to ask of another?

#### Questions to consider
1. Concern yourself with only whats in your control. 
2. Should we rely on others or fate for our misfortunes ?
3. Should people be concerned about conventional morals and norms when their necessities are not being met. 
4. Living a life of virtue and dignity is not an easy process so do whatever you have to protect your progress.
5. We fail to realise what is in our control and what is not 
6. Does poverty mean wealth in traditional sense or does it mean virtues or morals or rightesness
7. Misfortunes like "poor me" etc 
8. Is wealth moral and is moral wealth
9. Inner well being is to align fate/circumstances and be content with it or find happiness in it. [Unconventional wealth]

### Fromm, E. (1976) To have or To Be
>
>The Acquisitive Society—Basis for the Having Mode
Our judgments are extremely biased because we live in a society that rests
on private property, profit, and power as the pillars of its existence. To
acquire, to own, and to make a profit are the sacred and unalienable rights
of the individual in the industrial society.* What the sources of property
are does not matter; nor does possession impose any obligations on the
property owners. The principle is: "Where and how my property was
acquired or what I do with it is nobody's business but my own; as long as
I do not violate the law, my right is unrestricted and absolute."
This kind of property may be called private property (from Latin privare,
"to deprive of"), because the person or persons who own it are its sole
masters, with full power to deprive others of its use or enjoyment. While
private ownership is supposed to be a natural and universal category, it is
in fact an exception rather than the rule if we consider the whole of
human history (including prehistory), and particularly the cultures outside
Europe in which economy was not life's main concern. Aside from private
property, there are: self-created property, which is exclusively the result of
one's own work; restricted property, which is restricted by the obligation to
>
> help one's fellow beings; functional, or personal, property, which consists
either of tools for work or of objects for enjoyment; common property,
which a group shares in the spirit of a common bond, such as the Israeli
kibbutzim.
The norms by which society functions also mold the character of its
members (social character). In an industrial society these are: the wish to
acquire property, to keep it, and to increase it, i.e., to make a profit, and
those who own property are admired and envied as superior beings. But
the vast majority of people own no property in a real sense of capital and
capital goods, and the puzzling question arises: How can such people fulfill
or even cope with their passion for acquiring and keeping property, or how
can they feel like owners of property when they haven't any property to
speak of?
Of course, the obvious answer is that even people who are property poor
own something—and they cherish their little possessions as much as the
owners of capital cherish their property. And like the big property owners,
the poor are obsessed by the wish to preserve what they do have and to
increase it, even though by an infinitesimal amount (for instance by saving
a penny here, two cents there).
Perhaps the greatest enjoyment is not so much in owning material
things but in owning living beings. In a patriarchal society even the most
miserable of men in the poorest of classes can be an owner of property—in
his relationship to his wife, his children, his animals, over whom he can
feel he is absolute master. At least for the man in a patriarchal society,
having many children is the only way to own persons without needing to
work to attain ownership, and without capital investment. Considering
that the whole burden of childbearing is the woman's, it can hardly be
denied that the production of children in a patriarchal society is a matter
of crude exploitation of women. In turn, however, the mothers have their
own form of ownership, that of the children when they are small. The
circle is endless and vicious: the husband exploits the wife, she exploits the
small children, and the adolescent males soon join the elder men in
exploiting the women, and so on.
The male hegemony in a patriarchal order has lasted roughly six or
seven millennia and still prevails in the poorest countries or among the
poorest classes of society. It is, however, slowly diminishing in the more
affluent countries or societies—emancipation of women, children, and
adolescents seems to take place when and to the degree that a society's
standard of living rises. With the slow collapse of the old-fashioned,
>
> patriarchal type of ownership of persons, wherein will the average and the
poorer citizens of the fully developed industrial societies now find fulfillment of their passion for acquiring, keeping, and increasing property? The
answer lies in extending the area of ownership to include friends, lovers,
health, travel, art objects, God, one's own ego. A brilliant picture of the
bourgeois obsession with property is given by Max Stirner. Persons are
transformed into things; their relations to each other assume the character
of ownership. "Individualism," which in its positive sense means liberation
from social chains, means, in the negative sense, "self-ownership," the
right—and the duty—to invest one's energy in the success of one's own
person.
Our ego is the most important object of our property feeling, for it
comprises many things: our body, our name, our social status, our
possessions (including our knowledge), the image we have of ourselves
and the image we want others to have of us. Our ego is a mixture of real
qualities, such as knowledge and skills, and of certain fictitious qualities
that we build around a core of reality. But the essential point is not so
much what the ego's content is, but that the ego is felt as a thing we each
possess, and that this "thing" is the basis of our sense of identity.
This discussion of property must take into account that an important
form of property attachment that flourished in the nineteenth century has
been diminishing in the decades since the end of the First World War and
is little evident today. In the older period, everything one owned was
cherished, taken care of, and used to the very limits of its utility. Buying
was "keep-it" buying, and a motto for the nineteenth century might well
have been: "Old is beautiful!" Today, consumption is emphasized, not
preservation, and buying has become "throw-away" buying. Whether the
object one buys is a car, a dress, a gadget, after using it for some time, one
gets tired of it and is eager to dispose of the "old" and buy the latest model.
Acquisition transitory having and using throwing away (or if
possible, profitable exchange for a better model) --> new acquisition,
constitutes the vicious circle of consumer-buying and today's motto could
indeed be: "New is beautiful!"
Perhaps the most striking example of today's consumer-buying phenomenon is the private automobile. Our age deserves to be dubbed "the age of
the automobile," for our whole economy has been built around automobile production, and our whole life is greatly determined by the rise and
fall of the consumer market for cars.
>
> To those who have one, their car seems like a vital necessity; to those
who do not yet own one, especially people in the so-called socialist states,
a car is a symbol of joy. Apparently, however, affection for one's car is not
deep and abiding, but a love affair of somewhat short duration, for owners
change their cars frequently; after two years, even after just one, an auto
owner tires of the "old car" and starts shopping around for a "good deal" on
a new vehicle. From shopping around to purchase, the whole transaction
seems to be a game in which even trickery is sometimes a prime element,
and the "good deal" is enjoyed as much as, if not more than, the ultimate
prize: that brand-new model in the driveway.
Several factors must be taken into account in order to solve the puzzle
of the seemingly flagrant contradiction between the owners' property
relationship to their automobiles and their so-short-lived interest in them.
First, there is the element of depersonalization in the owner's relationship
to the car; the car is not a concrete object that its owner is fond of, but a
status symbol, an extension of power—an ego builder; having acquired a
car, the owner has actually acquired a new piece of ego. A second factor is
that buying a new car every two years instead of, say, every six increases
the buyer's thrill of acquisition; the act of making the new car one's own
is a kind of defloration—it enhances one's sense of control, and the more
often it happens, the more thrilled one is. The third factor is that frequent
car buying means frequent opportunities to "make a deal"—to make a
profit by the exchange—a satisfaction deeply rooted in men and women
today. The fourth factor is one of great importance: the need to experience
new stimuli, because the old stimuli are flat and exhausted after but a short
while. In an earlier discussion of stimuli (The Anatomy of Human Destructiveness), I differentiated between "activating" and "passivating" stimuli and
suggested the following formulation: "The more 'passivating' a stimulus is,
the more frequently it must be changed in intensity and/or in kind; the
more 'activating' it is, the longer it retains its stimulating quality and the
less necessary is change in intensity and content." The fifth and most
important factor lies in the change in social character that has occurred
during the past century and a half, i.e., from the "hoarding" to the
"marketing" character. While the change does not do away with the
having orientation, it does modify it considerably. (This development of
the marketing character is discussed in Chapter VII.)
The proprietary feeling also shows up in other relationships, for example
toward doctors, dentists, lawyers, bosses, workers. People express it in
speaking of "my doctor," "my dentist," "my workers," and so on. But aside
>
> from their property attitude toward other human beings, people experience an unending number of objects, even feelings, as property. Take
health and illness, for example. People who discuss their health do so with
a proprietary feeling, referring to their sicknesses, their operations, their
treatments—their diets, their medicines. They clearly consider that health
and sickness are property; their property relationship to their bad health is
analogous, say, to that of a stockholder whose shares are losing part of their
original value in a badly falling market.
Ideas and beliefs can also become property, as can even habits. For
instance, anyone who eats an identical breakfast at the same time each
morning can be disturbed by even a slight change in that routine, because
his habit has become a property whose loss endangers his security.
The picture of the universality of the having mode of existence may
strike many readers as too negative and one-sided; and indeed it is. I
wanted to portray the socially prevalent attitude first in order to give as
clear a picture as possible. But there is another element that can give this
picture a degree of balance, and that is a growing attitude among the
young generation that is quite different from the majority. Among these
young people we find patterns of consumption that are not hidden forms
of acquisition and having, but expressions of genuine joy in doing what
one likes to do without expecting anything "lasting" in return. These
young people travel long distances, often with hardships, to hear music
they like, to see a place they want to see, to meet people they want to
meet. Whether their aims are as valuable as they think they are is not the
question here; even if they are without sufficient seriousness, preparation,
or concentration, these young people dare to be, and they are not
interested in what they get in return or what they can keep. They also
seem much more sincere than the older generation, although often
philosophically and politically naive. They do not polish their egos all the
time in order to be a desirable "object" on the market. They do not protect
their image by constantly lying, with or without knowing it; they do not
expend their energy in repressing truth, as the majority does. And
frequently, they impress their elders by their honesty—for their elders
secretly admire people who can see or tell the truth. Among them are
politically and religiously oriented groups of all shadings, but also many
without any particular ideology or doctrine who may say of themselves
that they are just "searching." While they may not have found themselves,
or a goal that gives guidance to the practice of life, they are searching to be
themselves instead of having and consuming.
>
> This positive element in the picture needs to be qualified, however.
Many of these same young people (and their number has been markedly
decreasing since the late sixties) had not progressed from freedom from to
freedom to; they simply rebelled without attempting to find a goal toward
which to move, except that of freedom from restrictions and dependence.
Like that of their bourgeois parents, their motto was "New is beautiful!"
and they developed an almost phobic disinterest in all tradition, including
the thoughts that the greatest minds have produced. In a kind of naïve
narcissism they believed that they could discover by themselves all that is
worth discovering. Basically, their ideal was to become small children
again, and such authors as Marcuse produced the convenient ideology that
return to childhood—not development to maturity—is the ultimate goal of
socialism and revolution. They were happy as long as they were young
enough for this euphoria to last; but many of them have passed this period
with severe disappointment, without having acquired well-founded convictions, without a center within themselves. They often end up as
disappointed, apathetic persons—or as unhappy fanatics of destruction.
Not all who had started with great hopes ended up with disappointment,
however, but it is unfortunately impossible to know what their number is.
To my knowledge, no valid statistical data or sound estimates are available,
and even if they were available, it is almost impossible to be sure how to
qualify the individuals. Today, millions of people in America and Europe
try to find contact with tradition and with teachers who can show them
the way. But in large part the doctrines and teachers are either fraudulent,
or vitiated by the spirit of public relations ballyhoo, or mixed up with the
financial and prestige interests of the respective gurus. Some people may
genuinely benefit from such methods in spite of the sham; others will
apply them without any serious intention of inner change. But only a
detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis of the new believers could
show how many belong to each group.
My personal estimate is that the young people (and some older ones)
who are seriously concerned with changing from the having to the being
mode number more than a few dispersed individuals. I believe that quite
a large number of groups and individuals are moving in the direction of
being, that they represent a new trend transcending the having orientation
of the majority, and that they are of historical significance. It will not be the
first time in history that a minority indicates the course that historical
development will take. The existence of this minority gives hope for the
general change in attitude from having to being. This hope is all the more
>
> real since some of the factors that made it possible for these new attitudes
to emerge are historical changes that can hardly be reversed: the breakdown of patriarchal supremacy over women and of parents' domination of
the young. While the political revolution of the twentieth century, the
Russian revolution, has failed (it is too early to judge the final outcome of
the Chinese revolution), the victorious revolutions of our century, even
though they are only in their first stages, are the women's, the children's,
and the sexual revolutions. Their principles have already been accepted by
the consciousness of a great many individuals, and every day the old
ideologies become more ridiculous.
The Nature of Having
The nature of the having mode of existence follows from the nature of
private property. In this mode of existence all that matters is my acquisition
of property and my unlimited right to keep what I have acquired. The
having mode excludes others; it does not require any further effort on my
part to keep my property or to make productive use of it. The Buddha has
described this mode of behavior as craving, the Jewish and Christian
religions as coveting; it transforms everybody and everything into something dead and subject to another's power.
The sentence "I have something" expresses the relation between the
subject, I (or he, we, you, they), and the object, O. It implies that the
subject is permanent and the object is permanent. But is there permanence
in the subject? Or in the object? I shall die; I may lose the social position
that guarantees my having something. The object is similarly not permanent: it can be destroyed, or it can be lost, or it can lose its value. Speaking
of having something permanently rests upon the illusion of a permanent
and indestructible substance. If I seem to have everything, I have—in
reality—nothing, since my having, possessing, controlling an object is only
a transitory moment in the process of living.
In the last analysis, the statement "/ [subject] have 0 [object]" expresses
a definition of I through my possession of O. The subject is not myself but
I am what I have. My property constitutes myself and my identity. The
underlying thought in the statement "I am I" is "I am I because I have X"—X
equaling all natural objects and persons to whom I relate myself through
my power to control them, to make them permanently mine
In the having mode, there is no alive relationship between me and what
I have. It and I have become things, and I have it, because I have the force
> 
> to make it mine. But there is also a reverse relationship: it has me, because
my sense of identity, i.e., of sanity, rests upon my having it (and as many
things as possible). The having mode of existence is not established by an
alive, productive process between subject and object; it makes things of
both object and subject. The relationship is one of deadness, not aliveness.
Having—Force—Rebellion
The tendency to grow in terms of their own nature is common to all living
beings. Hence we resist any attempt to prevent our growing in the ways
determined by our structure. In order to break this resistance, whether it
is conscious or not, physical or mental force is necessary. Inanimate objects
resist control of their physical composition in various degrees through the
energy inherent in their atomic and molecular structures. But they do not
fight against being used. The use of heteronomous force with living beings
(i.e., the force that tends to bend us in directions contrary to our given
structure and that is detrimental to our growth) arouses resistance. This
resistance can take all forms, from overt, effective, direct, active resistance
to indirect, ineffectual, and, very often, unconscious resistance.
What is restricted is the free, spontaneous expression of the infant's, the
child's, the adolescent's, and eventually the adult's will, their thirst for
knowledge and truth, their wish for affection. The growing person is forced
to give up most of his or her autonomous, genuine desires and interests,
and his or her own will, and to adopt a will and desires and feelings that
are not autonomous but superimposed by the social patterns of thought
and feeling. Society, and the family as its psychosocial agent, has to solve
a difficult problem: How to break a person's will without his being aware of it?
Yet by a complicated process of indoctrination, rewards, punishments, and
fitting ideology, it solves this task by and large so well that most people
believe they are following their own will and are unaware that their will
itself is conditioned and manipulated.
The greatest difficulty in this suppression of the will exists with regard to
sexuality, because we deal here with a strong tendency of the natural order
that is less easy to manipulate than many other desires. For this reason
people try harder to fight their sexual desires than almost any other
human desire. No need to cite the various forms of the vilification of sex
from moral grounds (its evilness) to health grounds (masturbation does
physical harm). The church had to forbid birth control and extramarital
>
> sex, and it still sticks to these principles even today when prudence would
recommend a more tolerant course.
The effort made to suppress sex would be beyond our understanding if
it were for the sake of sex as such. Not sex, however, but the breaking of
human will is the reason for vilifying sex. A great number of the so-called
primitive societies have no sex tabu whatever. Since they function without
exploitation and domination, they do not have to break the individual's
will. They can afford not to stigmatize sex and to enjoy the pleasure of
sexual relations without guilt feelings. Most remarkable in these societies
is that this sexual freedom does not lead to sexual greed; that after a period
of relatively transient sexual relations couples find each other; that they
then have no desire to swap partners, but are also free to separate when
love has gone. For these not-property-oriented groups sexual enjoyment is
an expression of being, not the result of sexual possessiveness. In saying
this I do not imply that we should return to living as these primitive
societies do—not that we could, even if we wanted to, for the simple
reason that the process of individuation and individual differentiation and
distance that civilization has brought about gives individual love a different
quality from that in primitive society. We cannot regress; we can only
move forward. What matters is that new forms of propertylessness will do
away with the sexual greed that is characteristic of all having societies.
Sexual desire is one expression of independence that is expressed very
early in life (masturbation). Its denunciation serves to break the will of the
child and make it feel guilty, and thus more submissive. To a large extent
the impulse to break sexual tabus is essentially an attempt at rebellion
aimed at restoring one's freedom. But the breaking of sexual tabus as such
does not lead to greater freedom; the rebellion is drowned, as it were, in
the sexual satisfaction . . . and in the person's subsequent guilt. Only the
achievement of inner independence is conducive to freedom and ends the
need for fruitless rebellion. The same holds true for all other behavior that
aims at doing the forbidden as an attempt to restore one's freedom. Indeed,
tabus create sexual obsessiveness and perversions, but sexual obsessiveness and
perversions do not create freedom.
The rebellion of the child manifests itself in many other ways: by the
child's not accepting the rules of cleanliness training; by not eating, or by
overeating; by aggression and sadism, and by many kinds of self-destructive acts. Often the rebellion manifests itself in a kind of general "slowdown strike"—a withdrawal of interest in the world, laziness, passivity, up
>
> to the most pathological forms of slow self-destruction. The effects of this
power struggle between children and parents is the subject of David E.
Schecter's paper on "Infant Development." All data indicate that heteronomous interference with the child's and the later person's growth process is the
deepest root of mental pathology, especially of destructiveness.
It must be clearly understood, though, that freedom is not laissez-faire
and arbitrariness. Human beings have a specific structure—like any other
species—and can grow only in terms of this structure. Freedom does not
mean freedom from all guiding principles. It means the freedom to grow
according to the laws of the structure of human existence (autonomous
restrictions). It means obedience to the laws that govern optimal human
development. Any authority that furthers this goal is "rational authority"
when this furtherance is achieved by way of helping to mobilize the child's
activity, critical thinking, and faith in life. It is "irrational authority" when
it imposes on the child heteronomous norms that serve the purposes of the
authority, but not the purposes of the child's specific structure.
The having mode of existence, the attitude centered on property and
profit, necessarily produces the desire—indeed the need—for power. To
control other living human beings we need to use power to break their
resistance. To maintain control over private property we need to use power
to protect it from those who would take it from us because they, like us,
can never have enough; the desire to have private property produces the
desire to use violence in order to rob others in overt or covert ways. In the
having mode, one's happiness lies in one's superiority over others, in one's
power, and in the last analysis, in one's capacity to conquer, rob, kill. In the
being mode it lies in loving, sharing, giving.
Other Factors Supporting the Having Mode
Language is an important factor in fortifying the having orientation. The
name of a person—and we all have names (and maybe numbers if the
present-day trend toward depersonalization continues)—creates the illusion that he or she is a final, immortal being. The person and the name
become equivalent; the name demonstrates that the person is a lasting,
indestructible substance—and not a process. Common nouns have the
same function: i.e., love, pride, hate, joy give the appearance of fixed
substances, but such nouns have no reality and only obscure the insight
that we are dealing with processes going on in a human being. But even
>
> nouns that are names of things, such as "table" or "lamp," are misleading.
The words indicate that we are speaking of fixed substances, although
things are nothing but a process of energy that causes certain sensations in
our bodily system. But these sensations are not perceptions of specific things
like table or lamp; these perceptions are the result of a cultural process of
learning, a process that makes certain sensations assume the form of
specific percepts. We naively believe that things like tables and lamps exist
as such, and we fail to see that society teaches us to transform sensations
into perceptions that permit us to manipulate the world around us in order
to enable us to survive in a given culture. Once we have given such
percepts a name, the name seems to guarantee the final and unchangeable
reality of the percept.
The need to have has still another foundation, the biologically given desire
to live. Whether we are happy or unhappy, our body impels us to strive for
immortality. But since we know by experience that we shall die, we seek for
solutions that make us believe that, in spite of the empirical evidence, we
are immortal. This wish has taken many forms: the belief of the Pharaohs
that their bodies enshrined in the pyramids would be immortal; many
religious fantasies of life after death, in the happy hunting grounds of early
hunter societies; the Christian and Islam paradise. In contemporary society
since the eighteenth century, "history" and "the future" have become the
substitutes for the Christian heaven: fame, celebrity, even notoriety—anything that seems to guarantee a footnote in the record of history—constitutes a bit of immortality. The craving for fame is not just secular
vanity—it has a religious quality for those who do not believe in the
traditional hereafter any more. (This is particularly noticeable among
political leaders.) Publicity paves the way to immortality, and the public
relations agents become the new priests.
But perhaps more than anything else, possession of property constitutes
the fulfillment of the craving for immortality, and it is for this reason that
the having orientation has such strength. If my self is constituted by what
I have, then I am immortal if the things I have are indestructible. From
Ancient Egypt to today—from physical immortality, via mummification of
the body, to mental immortality, via the last will—people have remained
alive beyond their physical/mental lifetimes. Via the legal power of the last
will the disposal of our property is determined for generations to come;
through the laws of inheritance, I—inasmuch as I am an owner of
capital—become immortal.

> The Having Mode and the Anal Character
A helpful approach to understanding the mode of having is to recall one of
Freud's most significant findings, that after going through their infant
phase of mere passive receptivity followed by a phase of aggressive
exploitative receptivity, all children, before they reach maturity, go
through a phase Freud designated the anal-erotic. Freud discovered that
this phase often remains dominant during a person's development, and
that when it does it leads to the development of the anal character, i.e., the
character of a person whose main energy in life is directed toward having,
saving, and hoarding money and material things as well as feelings,
gestures, words, energy. It is the character of the stingy individual and is
usually connected with such other traits as orderliness, punctuality,
stubbornness, each to a more than ordinary degree. An important aspect of
Freud's concept is the symbolic connection between money and feces
—gold and dirt—of which he quotes a number of examples. His concept of
the anal character as one that has not reached maturity is in fact a sharp
criticism of bourgeois society of the nineteenth century, in which the
qualities of the anal character constituted the norm for moral behavior and
were looked upon as the expression of "human nature." Freud's equation:
money = feces, is an implicit, although not intended, criticism of the
functioning of bourgeois society and its possessiveness and may be
compared with Marx's discussion of money in the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts.
It is of little importance in this context that Freud believed that a special
phase of the libido development was primary and that the character
formation was secondary (while in my opinion it is the product of the
interpersonal constellation in one's early life and, most of all, the social
conditions conducive to its formation). What matters is Freud's view that
the predominant orientation in possession occurs in the period before the achievement of full maturity and is pathological if it remains permanent. For Freud, in
other words, the person exclusively concerned with having and possession
is a neurotic, mentally sick person; hence it would follow that the society
in which most of the members are anal characters is a sick society.
Asceticism and Equality
Much of the moral and political discussion has centered on the question:
To have or not to have? On the moral-religious level this meant the
alternative between the ascetic life and the nonascetic life, the latter
>
> including both productive enjoyment and unlimited pleasure. This alternative loses most of its meaning if one's emphasis is not on the single act of
behavior but on the attitude underlying it. Ascetic behavior, with its
constant preoccupation with nonenjoyment, may be only the negation of
strong desires for having and consuming. In the ascetic these desires can be
repressed, yet in the very attempt to suppress having and consuming, the
person may be equally preoccupied with having and consuming. This
denial by over-compensation is, as psychoanalytic data show, very frequent. It occurs in such cases as fanatical vegetarians repressing destructive
impulses, fanatical antiabortionists repressing their murderous impulses,
fanatics of "virtue" repressing their own "sinful" impulses. What matters
here is not a certain conviction as such, but the fanaticism that supports it.
This, like all fanaticism, suggests the suspicion that it serves to cover other,
and usually the opposite, impulses.
In the economic and political field a similar erroneous alternative is
between unrestricted inequality and absolute equality of income. If
everybody's possessions are functional and personal, then whether someOne has somewhat more than another person does not constitute a social
problem, for since possession is not essential, envy does not grow. On the
other hand, those who are concerned with equality in the sense that each
one's share must be exactly equal to anyone else's show that their own
having orientation is as strong as ever, except that it is denied by their
preoccupation with exact equality. Behind this concern their real motivation is visible: envy. Those demanding that nobody should have more than
themselves are thus protecting themselves from the envy they would feel
if anyone had even an ounce more of anything. What matters is that both
luxury and poverty shall be eradicated; equality must not mean the
quantitative equality of each morsel of material goods, but that income is
not differentiated to a point that creates different experiences of life for
different groups. In the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts, Marx
pointed this out in what he calls "crude communism," which "negates the
personality of man in every sphere"; this type of communism "is only the
culmination of such envy and leveling-down on the basis of a preconceived minimum."
Existential Having
In order to fully appreciate the mode of having that we are dealing with
here, yet another qualification seems necessary, that of the function of

>existential having; for human existence requires that we have, keep, take
care of, and use certain things in order to survive. This holds true for our
bodies, for food, shelter, clothing, and for the tools necessary to produce
our needs. This form of having may be called existential having because it
is rooted in human existence. It is a rationally directed impulse in the
pursuit of staying alive—in contrast to the characterological having we have
been dealing with so far, which is a passionate drive to retain and keep that
is not innate, but that has developed as the result of the impact of social
conditions on the human species as it is biologically given.
Existential having is not in conflict with being; characterological having
necessarily is. Even the "just" and the "saintly," inasmuch as they are
human, must want to have in the existential sense—while the average
person wants to have in the existential and in the characterological sense.
(See the earlier discussion of existential and characterological dichotomies
in Man for Himself.)
