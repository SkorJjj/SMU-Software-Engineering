1. ```Option A``` is ```True``` because going from **student** to **room**, the crow feet model suggest that a student can either manage no room or many rooms.

2. ```Option B``` is ```False``` because going from **room** to **student**, the crow feet model shows double straight lines. This suggest that the minimum and max is one. A room has to be managed by one and only one student.

3. ```Option C``` is ```True```

4. ```Option D``` is ```False``` because table room can have reference to student.

## Tips

1. If the sentence says 
EG:    
  a. ```Each Attribute is identified by the Another_Attribute along with
a Foreign_Key ```    
  b. ```A Relation is identified by the Another_Relationâ€™s identification number and its own Attribute_ID ```   
  
It implies that this relation is a weak entity.   


2. Use verbs such as "has" to imply causal relationships. Eg. Chemist "Has" Assigned_Project "Has" Project
 
3. Aim to achieve third normal form.   
4. Look out for derived attributes. The common ones are ```Age``` from ```Date of Birth```.
5. Associated relationship is usually identified by the statement ``` The database is interested in keeping track of...```.
